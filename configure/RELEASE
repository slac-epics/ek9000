# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU CHANGE ANY PATHS in this file or make API changes to
# any modules it refers to, you should do a "make rebuild" in
# this application's top level directory.
#
# The EPICS build process does not check dependencies against
# any files from outside the application, so it is safest to
# rebuild it completely if any modules it depends on change.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file is parsed by both GNUmake and an EPICS Perl script,
# so it may ONLY contain definititions of paths to other support
# modules, variable definitions that are used in module paths,
# and include statements that pull in other RELEASE files.
# Variables may be used before their values have been set.
# Build variables that are NOT used in paths should be set in
# the CONFIG_SITE file.
# Variables and paths to dependent modules:
#MODULES = /path/to/modules
#MYMODULE = $(MODULES)/my-module

# If using the sequencer, point SNCSEQ at its top directory:
#SNCSEQ = $(MODULES)/seq-ver

-include $(TOP)/RELEASE_SITE

# Set RULES here if you want to use build rules from somewhere
# other than EPICS_BASE:
#RULES = $(MODULES)/build-rules

#  ==========================================================
# Define the version strings for all needed modules
# Use naming pattern:
#   FOO_MODULE_VERSION = R1.2
# so scripts can extract version strings
# Don't set your version to anything such as "test" that
# could match a directory name.
# ==========================================================
ASYN_MODULE_VERSION=R4.39-1.0.1
MODBUS_MODULE_VERSION=R3.2-1.0.1

# ==========================================================
# Define module paths using pattern
# FOO = $(EPICS_MODULES)/foo/$(FOO_MODULE_VERSION)
#  or
# FOO = /Full/Path/To/Development/Version
